            What is Accident?
          </span>
          A vehicle (road traffic) accident is essentially a collision involving
          one or more vehicles (cars, motorcycles, trucks, etc.) on a public
          road, often also involving pedestrians or stationary objects. In
          technical terms, a road traffic accident (RTA) is “an accident
          occurring on a road or road open to public transport, resulting in the
          death or injury of one or more individuals and the presence of at
          least one moving vehicle”. In other words, any crash on the public way
          that causes injury or damage qualifies as a vehicle accident. Such
          incidents can range from minor fender-benders to catastrophic
          collisions causing multiple fatalities and disabilities.

            Plane crash
          </span>{" "}
          is also another tragic accident involving an aircraft that fails to
          land safely, often resulting in damage, injuries, or loss of life.
          These crashes can be caused by technical failures, weather conditions,
          human error, or even intentional acts. Though rare, the impact of
          plane crashes is profound—they lead to loss of lives, emotional trauma
          for families, and financial costs for airlines and governments.
          Globally, they also raise concerns about aviation safety, trigger
          investigations, and often lead to improvements in air travel
          technology, training, and regulations to help prevent future
          tragedies.

              How is accident a global threat?
            </span>
            Vehicle crashes are a major global public health and social problem.
            Every year roughly 1.2 million people die worldwide in road
            collisions, and another 20–50 million suffer non-fatal injuries
            (many of which lead to permanent disability) . These tolls make
            traffic crashes one of the leading causes of death and injury
            globally, especially among the young: road injuries are the #1 cause
            of death for people aged 5–29 years. The burden falls
            disproportionately on low- and middle-income countries (which
            account for about 92% of the deaths despite having ~60% of vehicles)

                Human impact:
              </span>
              Millions of families are affected each year. Victims may be
              killed, severely injured, or disabled, creating lifelong medical
              and social needs. One study notes that crashes “lead to poverty by
              causing loss of productivity, injury, disability, sorrow, and
              death” . Survivors often require long‑term care, and loved ones
              may suffer psychological trauma. Vulnerable road users
              (pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists) bear many of the casualties

                Economic cost:
              </span>
              Crashes impose a huge economic burden. The World Health
              Organization estimates road crashes cost most countries on the
              order of 3% of GDP. These costs include emergency response,
              medical care, vehicle damage, and lost productivity for victims
              and caregivers. For example, the UK estimates about £43 billion in
              crash costs annually (roughly 1.4% of GDP) . Globally, these costs
              can translate to an effective “tax” on the economy – one Lancet
              analysis equated road injuries to about 0.1% of world GDP each
              year.

                Social impact:

              Beyond dollars, crashes disrupt communities and slow development.
              Young people killed or disabled represent future workers and
              parents. Families often face financial hardship when a breadwinner
              dies or is injured. Child traffic deaths and injuries create
              long-term disability burdens. In many places, serious crash
              injuries exceed deaths by a wide margin, placing heavy demands on
              healthcare and social systems

            After collecting the vehicle accident data, a complete data pipeline
            was followed to ensure accurate, meaningful, and actionable
            insights. The pipeline consisted of five major stages: Data
            Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Integration, Data Analysis, and Data
            Visualization. The data was first gathered from
            data.montgomerycountymd.gov, then cleaned to handle missing values,
            remove duplicates, and standardize formats. After that, relevant
            fields were integrated to create a unified dataset that supported
            deep analysis. Using Tableau Public for visualization, the analysis
            revealed key trends such as the most common types of collisions,
            peak accident times, high-risk road conditions, and contributing
            factors like driver substance abuse or weather. These insights can
            help inform local authorities, policymakers, and the public in
            implementing targeted safety improvements to reduce traffic-related
            injuries, fatalities, and economic loss.

            Even though impaired driving is universally recognized as dangerous,

            </span>
            Combining this alcohol/substance abuse insight with other factors
            (weather, time, lane, and distance), it’s evident that driver
            behavior under impairment is a major crash factor—especially at
            night and during certain months. Tackling impaired driving should be
            a priority intervention area in your vehicle crash reduction
            strategy.

            These insights provide a multi-angle view of factors driving vehicle
            accidents. A data-backed strategy that addresses driver behavior,
            road infrastructure, law enforcement, and data reporting will be
            essential in reducing accident rates. Empowering departments with
            this intelligence can significantly enhance public safety, resource
            allocation, and policy effectiveness.

            Though many crashes occur at night, under clear skies, when
            visibility is high — yet impairment due to alcohol or drugs is
            likely driving the majority of these accidents. This insight
            challenges the assumption that bad weather is the primary risk
            factor
